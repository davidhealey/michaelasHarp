To create this wonderful library we spent a day in the studio with the talented Michaela Dorrity. Michaela studied with Brenda O’Somochain in Derry, receiving her Senior 4 (grade 8) certificate in 2012.

Since that time she’s been taught by Máire Ní Chathasiagh, Rachel Newton and Fiana Ní Chonaill and competed in the Fleadh Irish music competition, qualifying for the All Ireland Fleadh and reaching first place in the Donegal, and Northern Region of Britain Fleadhs.

If you’d like to hear the real instrument in action or have Michaela perform at an event you can contact her through her [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/MichaelaDorrityHarp/).
