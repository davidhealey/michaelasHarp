The traditional Celtic harp is an ancient instrument native to Ireland, Scotland, Wales, and parts of Northern France. For this library I recorded a modern harp with a warm tone and a built in pick-up. This allowed me to create a direct input (DI) recording in addition to two stereo microphone positions.

Michaela’s Harp is a beautifully sampled Celtic harp virtual instrument. It features three microphone positions, multiple velocity layers, damped and stopped samples, and playable triplets.

The library was recorded in a studio rather than a large hall so the samples aren’t particularly wet which will help you to blend and layer them with your other instruments.
